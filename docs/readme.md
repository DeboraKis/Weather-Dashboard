## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this project
2. Open index.html in your browser
3. Start searching for weather in different cities

## Production Implementation

The current implementation uses mock data so it can run without an API key. To implement with real weather data:

1. Sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Replace the mock data implementation in app.js with the functions from weatherAPI.js
3. Add your API key to the weatherAPI.js file

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 with CSS variables
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries)
- Local Storage API
- Fetch API

## Future Enhancements

- Add geolocation to get weather for the user's current location
- Add a dark mode toggle
- Add unit conversion (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
- Add weather maps
- Implement more detailed weather information
